# Mediator Pattern Example with CQRS and EF Core
This project showcases my understanding and practical application of the mediator pattern with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Entity Framework Core. By building a RESTful API that allows you to create, update, delete, and retrieve orders, I demonstrated my ability to apply MediatR, a popular library for implementing the mediator pattern in .NET applications, and my proficiency in using ASP.NET Core to build web applications.

## Key Features
* Utilized the mediator pattern with CQRS and EF Core to design and implement a RESTful API for managing orders.
* Implemented commands, queries, and responses using MediatR to separate the application logic from the infrastructure code.

## Conclusion
This project showcases my technical skills and knowledge in .NET development, specifically in the mediator pattern, CQRS, and Entity Framework Core. It also demonstrates my ability to follow best practices and write clean, maintainable code. Overall, this project represents my passion for learning and applying new technologies to build robust and scalable web applications.
